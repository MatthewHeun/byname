}
\arguments{
\item{m}{a matrix or a list of matrices}

\item{col_names}{a vector of Strings containing the column names to keep
or delete (if names are preceded by a \code{-}).
Retaining columns takes precedence over removing columns.
If \code{m} contains none of the requested columns to be retained, \code{NULL} is returned.
If \code{m} contains none of the requested columns to be removed, \code{m} is returned.}

\value{
matrix with columns selected according to \code{col_names}.

\examples{
m <- matrix(1:16, ncol = 4, dimnames=list(c(paste0("i", 1:4)), paste0("c", 1:4))) \%>\%
  setrowtype("Industries") \%>\% setcoltype("Commodities")
select_cols_byname(m, c("c1", "c4"))
select_cols_byname(m, c("-c1", "-c4", "-----c3", "c2", "c4", "c4")) # Retain take precedence over remove.
select_cols_byname(m, "x") # Matches nothing. NULL is returned
select_cols_byname(m, "-x") # Matches nothing. m is returned
# Also works for lists
select_cols_byname(list(m,m), col_names = list(c("c1", "c4"), c("c2", "c3")))
select_cols_byname(list(m,m), col_names = c("c1", "c4"))
