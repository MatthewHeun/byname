\title{Vectorize a matrix}
\usage{
vectorize_byname(a, sep = " ")
}
\arguments{
\item{a}{the matrix to be vectorized}

\item{sep}{a string to separate row names and col names in the resulting column vector. Default is " " (a space).}
}
\value{
a column vector containing all elements of \code{a}, with row names assigned as "rowname \code{sep} colname".
}
\description{
Converts a matrix into a column vector.
Each element of the matrix becomes an entry in the column vector,
with rows named as "rowname \code{sep} colname" of the matrix entry.
}
\details{
\code{rowtype} and \code{coltype} attributes are retained in the event that
the resulting vector is re-matricized with the \code{matricize_byname} function later.
}
\examples{
m <- matrix(c(1, 5,
              4, 5),
            nrow = 2, ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE, 
            dimnames = list(c("p1", "p2"), c("i1", "i2"))) \%>\% 
  setrowtype("Products") \%>\% setcoltype("Industries")
vectorize_byname(m, sep = " -> ")
# If a single number is provided, the number will be returned as a 1x1 column vector 
# with some additional attributes.
vectorize_byname(42)
attributes(vectorize_byname(42))
# If call with `NULL`, get `NULL` back
vectorize_byname(NULL)
