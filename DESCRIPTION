Description: Am implementation of matrix mathematics operations that respects 
    names for rows and columns. 
    For example, when two matrices with different row and column names are summed, 
    the value of the sum contains the union of rows and columns of both matrices,
    with missing rows and columns inserted as zeroes prior to the sum operation.
    This package also provides the capability to provide "types" for the data 
    in rows and columns. 
    For example, rows might contain industries and columns might contain products.
    The functions contained in this package simplify
    matrix mathematics in situations where operand matrices are from different data sources.
